# Daily_Expense_Logger
 **Overview:**  
The **Daily Expense Logger** is a simple yet effective web-based application designed to help users track and manage their daily expenses. It provides an easy-to-use interface where users can enter expense details such as the **category, name, date, amount, and additional notes**. The application stores these expenses in a database, allowing users to view their past spending and organize their expenses efficiently.  
**Objective:**  
The main goal of this project is to create a **basic expense tracking system** where users can log their daily expenditures and categorize them based on their type, such as **buying items, food expenses, and financial transactions**. This will help users analyze their spending patterns and make informed financial decisions.  

**Features of the Project:**  
1. **User-Friendly Interface:**  
   - The application is designed with a simple and intuitive UI using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
   - Forms allow users to input their expense details effortlessly.  

2. **Expense Entry Form:**  
   - Users can enter the following details for each expense:  
     - **Category** (e.g., food, shopping, travel, etc.)  
     - **Name** (description of the expense)  
     - **Date** (date of the expense)  
     - **Amount** (total cost of the expense)  
     - **Additional Details** (optional notes)  

3. **Data Storage with MySQL:**  
   - Expenses are stored securely in a **MySQL database** using **JSP/Servlet** for backend processing.  

4. **View Saved Expenses:**  
   - Users can view their past expenses to track their spending habits.  

5. **Categorization of Expenses:**  
   - Expenses can be arranged into categories for better financial management.

   - Graphical representation of spending trends.  
   - Budget setting and alerts.  
   - Authentication system for user-specific expense tracking.

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** JSP, Servlet  
- **Database:** MySQL or Oracle  
- **Development Approach:** Simple and scalable, with planned improvements in future versions  

**Scope for Future Development**: 
Currently, the project is a basic expense tracker, but in the future, additional functionalities like expense analysis, graphical reports, automated calculations, and multi-user support can be added. The aim is to gradually develop this into a full-fledged financial tracking application.  
This project serves as an excellent learning experience for JSP and MySQL while building a real-world financial application.
